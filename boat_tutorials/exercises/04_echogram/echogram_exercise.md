# Echogram exercise

Questions:
1. The scattering phenomena in echogram1 and echogram2 appear very different. Based on what we know about sound propagation and scattering, what biological and/or physical factors do you think can explain these difference?
2. Echogram3 and echogram4 are the same "view" of the ocean observed at different frequencies. Based on what you know about transmission loss, which one do you this came from a higher frequency channel?
